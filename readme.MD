# Data
- First me must figure out how to get a corpus of data from wikipedia
- Use Wikipedia libary to gather plain text
- Build a fucntion that will grab pages based off of a file that it takes in with a list of pages
  - The function will first take in a list of topics
  - It will downlaod based off the list
  - It will store those pages into a folder /data/Topic/pageContent
